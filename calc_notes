Bug list:
	- when there's one sign, you can append another [x]
	- Pressing equal for the first time before running any operatinon returns NaN [x]
	- Pressing equal for the first time when running an operation returns NaN [x]
	- Performed calculations twice (in the equals function and in the operators function) and displayed an empty screen after multiplication and division [x]
	- Numbers are not rounded to 2 decimal points [x]
	- When there's an operator and the second number, clicking another operator performs the operation with that one instead of replacing it -> Has to perform operation and transfer that second operator into the next one [x]
	- Equals is not working prorperly[x]
	- Add logic for having zero as default value in current input [x]
		- Replacing it with the first entered value on first enter [x]
		- Setting it back to zero when clickicng "clear" [x]
	- Clear button works [x]
	- Add a case when the user is pressing equals while there's no operator / second number -> has to jsut keep the current input -> currently erases the current input [x] (solved by a check of operator == null and setting it to null after every equal click)
	- When the user seees the result, output it in the current input until they click on the operator -> currently displayed in the previous and you can input in the current without any operator [x]
	- Has to handle keyboard input []
	- Delete button works []
	- Fix the toFix() TypeError []
