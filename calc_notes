Bug list:
	- when there's one sign, you can append another [x]
	- Pressing equal for the first time before running any operatinon returns NaN [x]
	- Pressing equal for the first time when running an operation returns NaN [x]
	- Performed calculations twice (in the equals function and in the operators function) and displayed an empty screen after multiplication and division [x]
	- Add a case when the user is pressing equals while there's no operator / second number -> has to jsut keep the current input -> currently erases the current input []
	- Numbers are not rounded to 2 decimal points []
	- Has to handle keyboard input []
	- When there's an operator and the second number, clicking another operator performs the operation with that one instead of replacing it -> Has to perform operation and transfer that second operator into the next one []
